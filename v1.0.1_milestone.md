## Objectives
| Goal | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Regional parameterization | Support per-basin thresholds & multipliers via `config/region_parameters.json` | ✅ Implemented (skeleton) |
| Soil Moisture Index (SMI) | Include SMI to increase sensitivity after saturated conditions | ✅ Implemented (skeleton) |
| Rainfall lag response | Add multiplier for short-term heavy rainfall (48h) | ✅ Implemented (skeleton) |
| Validation metrics | Compute Brier score and log to CSV | ✅ Implemented (skeleton) |
| Dashboard improvements | Dropdown, diagnostics, and refresh button | ✅ Implemented (skeleton) |

---
_Plenary tasks:_ integrate live data sources (NOAA, soil moisture), tune parameters with historical runs, and add automated validation thresholds.

🧠 Technical Notes
	•	Transitioning dashboard data fetching from relative paths to a /data/ subdirectory for compatibility with GitHub Pages.
	•	Expanding ensemble logic for more realistic “lagged signal” modeling (rainfall + river response delay).
	•	Preparing for integration with public NOAA/ERA5 datasets in future versions.
