### 🧭 Objectives
| Goal | Description | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| **Regional Forecast Selection Upgrade** | Enable clearer separation and labeling of zones within the dashboard UI (e.g., Mississippi Basin, Ohio Valley). | ⏳ Planned |
| **Enhanced Data Source Integration** | Add support for soil moisture and short-term cloudburst data to improve localized accuracy. | ⏳ Planned |
| **Automated Forecast Validation** | Introduce internal scoring metrics (e.g., Brier score, hit rate) to evaluate daily forecast performance. | ⏳ Planned |
| **Public API Endpoint (Optional)** | Generate a `/api/latest.json` file in the repo to allow external sites or apps to fetch live forecasts. | ⏳ Under Review |
| **Visual Improvements** | Refine alert color gradients and mobile responsiveness in the dashboard template. | ⏳ Planned |
| **Community Contribution Guide** | Create step-by-step documentation for contributors (adding new basins, tuning parameters). | ⏳ Planned |

🧠 Technical Notes
	•	Transitioning dashboard data fetching from relative paths to a /data/ subdirectory for compatibility with GitHub Pages.
	•	Expanding ensemble logic for more realistic “lagged signal” modeling (rainfall + river response delay).
	•	Preparing for integration with public NOAA/ERA5 datasets in future versions.
